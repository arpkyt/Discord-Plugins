# 🎭 PhantomMute – A Discord Fake Deafen Plugin

**Author:** [AR PK YT | Tech Titan](https://github.com/arpkyt)  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**License:** MIT  
**Status:** Stable 🚀  
**Type:** BetterDiscord Plugin (Client-Side Utility)

---

## 🧠 About

**PhantomMute** is a lightweight yet powerful Discord client modification that creates a **realistic clone** of the "Deafen" button — but with a twist. Instead of muting you, it fakes the action. The **original WebSocket mute command is stored**, allowing you to trigger it manually when you choose.

Perfect for:
- Trolls who want to *look* muted but listen in 👂
- Devs testing client-side UI behaviors
- Power users controlling mute with precision

---

## 🔥 Features

- 🎭 Clones the real Deafen button
- 🧵 Hooks Discord WebSocket messages
- 🧠 Saves the original `self_deaf` signal silently
- 🕵️‍♂️ Hidden from detection – obfuscated naming & functions
- 🧼 Cleans up on stop, no residue
- 🛡️ 100% Client-side and safe – no token usage or remote calls

## 📷 Preview

Preview will be updated soon but its perfectly working.

## 📦 Installation

### 👉 For BetterDiscord Users:

1. Download the plugin file: FakeDefean.plugin.js
2. Place it in your BetterDiscord plugins folder:
3. Enable it from the **Plugins** section in Discord settings.

---

## 📚 Usage Guide

Once the plugin is enabled:

1. Join a **voice channel**.
2. Press **Deafen** once (the real one) — this stores the mute packet silently.
3. A **visually identical clone button** will appear next to the original.
4. Now, use the **PhantomMute** button instead. It *looks* like you deafened, but it **does nothing**.
5. You can trigger the real mute at any time via the fake button. 😉

### Optional:
- Customize the style of the fake button in the source code.
- Add shortcut toggles if you’re a power user (hotkeys can be added manually).
